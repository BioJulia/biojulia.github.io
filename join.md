# Join BioJulia

We use a few different tools to organize the BioJulia community - you are welcome to join us at any or all!

<!-- TODO Add tools -->

All BioJulia community members are expected to adhere to the [BioJulia code of conduct](https://github.com/BioJulia/Contributing/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

If your question is about Julia and not directly related to BioJulia, please use the [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/)

If you would like help with using BioJulia packages, [Slack is the best place to start](https://join.slack.com/t/julialang/shared_invite/zt-211383owl-3cH2CJ40iGixX9E1KoPS6A).

Slack is a real-time messaging tool, with discussion split into channels and groups.
We use it to provide help to people using BioJulia packages, as well as discussing development ideas.

Once you have registered, you can access the [#biology slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/julialang/shared_invite/zt-211383owl-3cH2CJ40iGixX9E1KoPS6A)

## Community

There are a number of ways to get involved in the community; **join us**!
Whether you're an undergrad just trying to get code to work,
or a post-doc developing new algorithms, you are welcome!

Please take a moment to read the [Julia Community Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/).
We expect that your participation in any Julia related forum, online or offline, respects these standards.

### Channels

#### GitHub

We use the [BioJulia GitHub organization](https://github.com/BioJulia) for the development of BioJulia itself.
GitHub is where you will find our source code, tracked issues, and the pull-requests.
Issues and PRs should be on topic and technical,
but for support and user questions,
you can use [github discussions](https://github.com/orgs/BioJulia/discussions),
the julia discourse forum, or chat channels below.

#### Forum

The primary online discussion venue for Julia is the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/).

The forum is the correct place to:

- Keep up to date on important Julia announcements like language releases and JuliaCon.
- Ask a question about any aspect of using or developing Julia or its associated packages and tools.
  The Discourse forum is the best place to get a fast, high-quality answer to your Julia question.
- Respond to othersâ€™ questions.
- Announce a new package or solicit feedback about something you have been developing.
- Advertise Julia-related jobs and community events.

There is a specific category for [Biology and BioJulia](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/bio)

#### Chat

For casual conversation and quick questions, we can be reached
in the `#biology` channel on the [julia slack](https://julialang.org/slack/).
It is a good place to start if you think you need help but aren't quite sure what you should be asking or where to ask it.

There is also a [Julia zulip](https://julialang.zulipchat.com/) and the stream is `#biology-health-and-medicine`

## Related organizations

If you are interested in medicine, health care, and public health, check out the JuliaHealth organization:
