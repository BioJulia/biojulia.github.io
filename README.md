# biojulia.github.io
Project website

The BioJulia website is generated as a static page using jekyll.
The intent is to make it easy to maintain, as most changes to the website should
only require changes to files in the `_data` directory, and new posts should
require only the addition of simple Markdown formatted files to the `_posts`
folder.
