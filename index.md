## Community

There are a number of ways to get involved in the community; **join us**!
Whether you're an undergrad just trying to get code to work,
or a post-doc developing new algorithms, you are welcome!

Please take a moment to read the [Julia Community Standards](https://julialang.org/community/standards/).
We expect that your participation in any Julia related forum, online or offline, respects these standards.

### Channels

#### GitHub

We use the [BioJulia GitHub organization](https://github.com/BioJulia) for the development of BioJulia itself.
GitHub is where you will find our source code, tracked issues, and the pull-requests.
Issues and PRs should be on topic and technical,
but for support and user questions,
you can use [github discussions](https://github.com/orgs/BioJulia/discussions),
the julia discourse forum, or chat channels below.

#### Forum

The primary online discussion venue for Julia is the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/).

The forum is the correct place to:

- Keep up to date on important Julia announcements like language releases and JuliaCon.
- Ask a question about any aspect of using or developing Julia or its associated packages and tools.
  The Discourse forum is the best place to get a fast, high-quality answer to your Julia question.
- Respond to othersâ€™ questions.
- Announce a new package or solicit feedback about something you have been developing.
- Advertise Julia-related jobs and community events.

There is a specific category for [Biology and BioJulia](https://discourse.julialang.org/c/domain/bio)

#### Chat

For casual conversation and quick questions, we can be reached
in the `#biology` channel on the [julia slack](https://julialang.org/slack/).
It is a good place to start if you think you need help but aren't quite sure what you should be asking or where to ask it.
