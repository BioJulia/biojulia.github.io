We are pleased to announce that our package for working with biological
sequences in julia, BioAlignments.jl, has been released.

The current version is 0.2.

We hope you enjoy using this package in your work.

This version of BioSequences has the same features and functionality as 0.6.x,
but crucially, drops support for julia 0.5 and updates the syntax to the latest
julia standard.

As always, comments, feedback and contributions to any of our software projects
is greatly appreciated.

Happy coding! :)

Ben.
