Over the next few weeks all of our packages are going to be updated, to no longer
use compat to maintain compatibility with julia version 0.5, and to update the
syntax and push to julia version 0.6.

This makes the strain of maintaining the packages more bearable for us, but also
encourages users to use the latest version of julia, and to write code in up
to date and idiomatic julia syntax.

As always, comments, feedback and contributions to any of our software projects
is greatly appreciated.

Happy Coding :)

Ben.
