We are happy to announce the first release of BioBridgeR.jl.

BioBridgeR.jl extends [RCall.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl)
and provides compatibility types in julia for classes defined in R packages.
This allows you to send classes in an R session over to the julia session,
converting it into the appropriate BioJulia data type as you do so.
Conversely, data-types from BioJulia packages can be transferred over to an
R session as an appropriate class for your R packages.

As always, comments, feedback and contributions to any of our software projects
is greatly appreciated.

Happy Coding :)

Ben.
