We are pleased to announce that our package for working with genomic
annotation in julia, GenomicFeatures.jl, has been updated to version 0.2.

In version 0.2, optional filter functions have been added to the `eachoverlap`,
and a `findfirst` functions to enable more flexible processing of intervals.

As always, comments, feedback and contributions to any of our software projects
is greatly appreciated.

Happy coding! :)

Ben.
