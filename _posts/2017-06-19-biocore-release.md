We are happy to announce a minor updated release of BioCore.jl.

Version 1.1.0 adds a submodule to BioCore.jl called `Testing`.
This submodule defines several functions to assist in the creation of
test suites for other BioJulia packages.

BioCore.jl has also been updated to be compatible with julia version 0.6.

Happy Coding :)

Ben.
