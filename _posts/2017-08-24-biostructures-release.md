We are pleased to announce that our package for working with biological
structures in julia, BioStructures.jl, has been released.

The current version is 0.1.

We hope you enjoy using this package in your work.

BioStructures provides functionality to read, write and manipulate
macromolecular structures, in particular proteins.
[Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/home/home.do) (PDB) format files
can be read in to a hierarchical data structure. Basic spatial calculations and
functions to access the PDB are also provided.

As always, comments, feedback and contributions to any of our software projects
is greatly appreciated.

Happy coding! :)

Joe
