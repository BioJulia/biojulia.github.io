We are pleased to announce that our package for working with sequence alignments in julia,
BioAlignments.jl, has been released at version 0.1.

BioAlignments includes tools necessary for processing SAM and BAM file formats,
in addition to pairwise alignment algorithms for HTS data.

As always, comments, feedback and contributions to any of our software projects
is greatly appreciated.

Happy coding! :)

Ben.
