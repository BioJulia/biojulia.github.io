We are happy to announce the first release of BioCore.jl.

BioCore.jl provides function names and an IO interface that is common to many
packages in the BioJulia package ecosystem.
Packages import the definitions and then extend them with specific methods.

As always, comments, feedback and contributions to any of our software projects
is greatly appreciated.

Happy Coding :)

Ben.
