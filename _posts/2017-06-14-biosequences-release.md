We are pleased to announce that our package for working with biological
sequences in julia, BioSequences.jl, has been released.

The current version is 0.6.

We hope you enjoy using this package in your work.

As always, comments, feedback and contributions to any of our software projects
is greatly appreciated.

Work has already begun on getting GeneticVariation.jl, and GenomicIntervals.jl
ready for release.

Happy coding! :)

Ben.
