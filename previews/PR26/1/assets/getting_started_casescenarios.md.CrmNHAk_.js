Researchers are divided into teams that each serve one client at a time, though they all share the same laboratory and equipment. The need for an in-house programming division has arisen based on feedback from these teams facing many similar problems with the current workplace setup:</p><ul><li><p>Researchers may not be digitally literate, thus they require more accessible user interfaces</p></li><li><p>Lessening the number of tools they are required to learn would ideally reduce complexity and onboarding time</p></li><li><p>Some workflows can be repetitive and could take advantage of some automation to reduce overall time</p></li></ul><p>It is thus decided that a researcher-facing platform should be created that will host a suite of simple, web-based software tools. These can include tools usable by any researcher or by only one or several teams depending on their needs. The new division is given the following objectives:</p><ul><li><p>Collaborate with researchers and understand their software requirements</p></li><li><p>Use modern languages/frameworks to avoid technical headaches and allow for faster onboarding</p></li><li><p>Ensure access to both general and scientific libraries when needed for a specific tool</p></li></ul><p>Upon reviewing these objectives, the division begins discussing which tech stacks they should use. With a mix of veteran and junior talent, as well as a desire to allow for fast time-to-deployment and performance, it is agreed that a modern, higher-level programming language would be ideal. One of the collaborating researchers suggests they look into Julia, which has been the scripting language of choice amongst some of the teams for automating several workflows, and the division decides to push ahead with a trial.</p><p>The platform and first two tools for the collaborating research team are prototyped. The stack is built upon the <a href="https://genieframework.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Genie</a> web framework, which, crucially, enables authorization/authentication support on a team-by-team basis and HTML/CSS/JS interoperability. The entire platform is designed as a reactive app that can be deployed anywhere and is almost entirely written in Julia for both the frontend and backend. Further Genie ecosystem packages and plugins spur potential ideas like taking advantage of the included no-code <a href="https://learn.genieframework.com/guides/genie-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">UI builder</a> for producing team analytics dashboards.</p><p>The first tool conceived allows teams to upload, download, and manage files or datasets within the company&#39;s shared drive from the web. It is designed to handle data management on its own without the researchers needing to remember specific drive locations or other details, their only responsibility being categorization (data pulled from which instrument, for which project, etc.). The tool is able to manage the data by working with the company&#39;s S3 and S3 Glacier storage instances via the <a href="https://juliacloud.github.io/AWS.jl/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">AWS</a> package. A user-facing feature is also included that generates an <code>Artifacts.toml</code> file, allowing researchers to use Julia&#39;s <a href="https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/artifacts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Artifact system</a> to declaratively point to select data and download them when required. For the more tech savvy user, an input feature is set up to allow for <a href="https://duckdb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DuckDB</a> database queries for large datasets. An <a href="https://duckdb.org/docs/api/julia.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">official Julia package</a> is provided for this DBMS, however, a <a href="https://docs.binarybuilder.org/stable/jll/#JLL-packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">JLL</a> is also available for more direct use of the DuckDB program. The ability to bundle external programs written in other languages and treat them as first-class Julia packages also means that porting over common scientific tools greatly simplifies dependency management for both developers and researchers. Seamless interoperability also extends to the ability to interact with codes from other languages such as Python with <a href="https://juliapy.github.io/PythonCall.jl/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PythonCall</a>/<a href="https://github.com/JuliaPy/CondaPkg.jl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CondaPkg</a> and R with <a href="https://juliainterop.github.io/RCall.jl/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">RCall</a>.</p><p>The second tool conceived is designed specifically for a collaborating researcher who needs to determine total cell count following each cell passage. The researcher uploads a photo of a stained cell culture sample, along with inputs such as total medium volume and dilution factor. The developers make use of the <a href="https://juliaimages.org/stable/pkgs/segmentation/#ImageSegmentation.jl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ImageSegmentation</a> package for differentiating live and dead cells through the use of the watershed algorithm. A side-by-side view is generated with the original and segmented image, as well as the total number of markers indicating the amount of live cells.o Although only a prototype, the developers believe it would be more than possible to employ basic machine learning using the <a href="https://sciml.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SciML</a> ecosystem.</p><p>The trial period with the collaborating research team proves to be a success, and the company decides to fully commit to this Julia platform. Novel ideas are tossed about internally over which tools can further improve workflows, such as replacing their electronic lab notebook systems with <a href="https://plutojl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pluto</a> and embedding a quick statistics calculator for linear regression modelling with <a href="https://juliastats.org/GLM.jl/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GLM</a> and <a href="https://makie.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Makie</a>. It is even discussed how this platform may allow the company to eventually commercialize these tools for other contract research organizations that face the same challenges.</p><h2 id="Research" tabindex="-1">Research <a class="header-anchor" href="#Research" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Research {#Research}&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Tip</p><p>Visit <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Journal of Open Source Software</a> and <a href="https://proceedings.juliacon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">JuliaCon Proceedings</a> to explore several research packages written in Julia!</p></div><p>A freshly minted researcher begins the morning with a new directive from the principal investigator. Their lab specializes in translational cancer immunotherapy, and as of late have been exploring a potential avenue for T-cell activation in patients with a rare type of lymphoma. It is hoped that strengthening the expression of specific peptides involved in cellular adaptive immune response can lead to more effective treatment. One patient&#39;s blood has been sampled and delivered to the lab, with the goal of extacting and combing through the resulting expression data from various antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to identify abnormal peptide expression levels.</p><p>The researcher understands that the exploratory nature of this project will require an interactive environment from which results can be rapidly generated and saved/discarded. Previously, a number of challenges would get in the way of this workflow:</p><ul><li><p>Working with interactive languages had proven to be a hassle due to issues like competing build systems and environments</p></li><li><p>The REPL experience was often lacking due to missing features or lack of integrations with other tools like a package manager</p></li><li><p>Existing digital notebook solutions suffer from lackluster performance and difficulties with deployment and versioning</p></li><li><p>Writing high-performance software would require lower-level languages like C or Fortran, which would prove difficult for scientists without a computer science background</p></li></ul><p>They remember having heard of Julia from colleagues, and decide to give it a go. Installation proved to be very simple with the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup#installation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">juliaup</a> tool, and they proceed to read up on the basics from the <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Julia manual</a>. The first step, upon loading the Julia REPL, is to add the <a href="https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DrWatson</a> package to better track the project. With DrWatson and the built-in package manager, the researcher can geneate reproducible code for simulations, plotting, and data preparation.</p><p>At the same time, the researcher isolates the APCs via a microfluidic cell-sorting device. The patient&#39;s cells are encapsulated into individual droplets from which single-cell profiling can occur via Droplet-Sequencing (Drop-seq). The resulting data is stored in <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hierarchical_Data_Format" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">.h5 files</a> on the lab&#39;s shared drive. The researcher generates an <code>Artifacts.toml</code> file that utilizes Julia&#39;s built-in <a href="https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/artifacts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Artifact system</a> to point to these files in a persistent and reproducible manner. The researcher makes quick work of loading the data into Julia with the <a href="https://juliaio.github.io/HDF5.jl/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HDF5</a> package, and applies a number of steps with <a href="https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DataFrames</a>, <a href="https://tidierorg.github.io/TidierData.jl/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TidierData</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/jkrumbiegel/Chain.jl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Chain</a> to transform, normalize, and filter the data. Finally, principle component analysis (PCA) with <a href="https://biojulia.dev/SingleCellProjections.jl/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SingleCellProjections</a> is conducted, visualized with the help of the <a href="https://makie.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Makie</a> plotting package.</p><p>The whole project is saved by DrWatson and shared with the principal investigator for further discussion. PCA analysis leads them to focus on a narrow subset of APCs with elevated peptide expression levels which will be further investigated in subsequent studies. The researcher prepares a more digestible format of the results as a <a href="https://plutojl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pluto notebook</a> to share with colleagues the more pertinent observations, and finally a more formal research report with Julia code included is written with <a href="https://weavejl.mpastell.com/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Weave</a>. The lab is impressed with what was achieved with Julia, with many remarking how effortless it seemed to achieve great performance with such a high-level language.</p><h2 id="Education" tabindex="-1">Education <a class="header-anchor" href="#Education" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Education {#Education}&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A new teacher was recently hired to teach a biostatistics course for first-year students at the University of Concordia. This will be a new offering at the university, thus they have been given free reign to design their own course plan. They are most interested in engaging students with a series of practical components, including hands-on demonstrations and involved coding projects. They look for inspiration from similar courses, and finds that many are aiming to develop a strong foundation in statistical programming for handling data analysis, hypothesis testing, and other tasks.</p><p>A number of these courses teach R or Python3, which have been entrenched in statistics for a number of years. They also appear to be popular with new programmers due to being high-level and easy to learn. However, the new teacher encounters a number of issues that raise concern:</p><ul><li><p>Performance would become an issue with larger datasets or visual plots, with the language taking too long to generate output and thus wasting valuable class time</p></li><li><p>Both languages come with a number of design decisions that may confuse beginners, such as how they handle missing values and introduce complex object-oriented systems</p></li><li><p>Setting up reproducible environments with all the necessary bits (dependencies, data) in either language is challenging, with a number of limitations and choices presented including package manager, language implementation, etc.</p></li><li><p>There is a desire to avoid the &quot;two-language problem&quot; wherein parts of either language are written in another and thus introduce unneeded complexity</p></li></ul><p>A fellow professor recommends they look into Julia, which has already found success within certain departments. The teacher consults the <a href="https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Julia manual</a> and toys with the language itself and several statistical packages. They discover that Julia possesses a number of features relevant for both teaching and engaging with the course, including the built-in package manager and rich REPL experience, and decides to proceed forward with it.</p><p>The first objective is to create a presentation format with good aesthetics that can also demonstrate code samples. They discover how to set up interactive notebooks with <a href="https://plutojl.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pluto</a> that will be hosted in a <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">central repository</a> or online via a website or with solutions like <a href="https://pluto-on-binder.glitch.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Binder</a>. This has a number of advantages compared to PowerPoint or Markdown presentations:</p><ul><li><p>Easily run and experiment with code cells within a reproducible environment</p></li><li><p>Dependency management automatically handled via the built-in package manager</p></li><li><p>Share the code and lessons with students either as notebooks or as exported PDF/HTML pages</p></li></ul><p>To bundle the datasets with the notebooks, they take advantage of Julia&#39;s <a href="https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/artifacts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Artifact system</a> for handling and retrieving data from almost anywhere on the Internet.</p><p>With the course infrastructure set, attention is now put towards creating the actual course material. They can cover a number of biostatistics topics using powerful, well-established Julia packages:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://docs.juliaplots.org/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Plots</a> or <a href="https://docs.makie.org/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Makie</a> for data visualization</p></li><li><p><a href="https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">DataFrames</a>, <a href="https://csv.juliadata.org/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CSV</a>, and <a href="https://tidierorg.github.io/Tidier.jl/dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Tidier</a> for data handling</p></li><li><p>[Statistics] and [StatsBase] for general statistical functionality (scalar statistics, estimation, ...)</p></li><li><p><a href="https://juliastats.org/Distributions.jl/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Distributions</a> for probability and sampling</p></li><li><p><a href="https://juliastats.org/HypothesisTests.jl/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">HypothesisTests</a> for parametric (ANOVA, chi-squared, ...) and non-parametric testing</p></li><li><p><a href="https://juliastats.org/GLM.jl/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">GLM</a> for generalized linear modelling</p></li><li><p><a href="https://fluxml.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Flux</a> or <a href="https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">MLJ</a> for basic machine learning</p></li></ul><p>The course agenda is almost complete. However, just before the start of the semester, a new lesson on Tukey&#39;s honest significance test is added. There is no package written in Julia yet for this test, and there is little time left to develop the code on their own. Luckily, Julia posseses incredible interoperability with both Python3 and R, and they discover how to both call and bundle Scipy&#39;s <code>stats.tukey_hsd</code> function via <a href="https://cjdoris.github.io/PythonCall.jl/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PythonCall</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cjdoris/CondaPkg.jl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">CondaPkg</a>.</p><p>The teacher goes on to smoothly deliver the newly introduced course, empowered by Julia to deliver an engaging experience for teaching students both the fundamentals of biostatistics and of quality programming.</p>',33)])])}const g=a(o,[["render",s]]);export{u as __pageData,g as default};
